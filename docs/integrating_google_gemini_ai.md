# üß† Integrating Google Gemini AI (Gemini 1.5 Pro) into Your Work Schedule App

## üí° Core Idea

Gemini can act as a **smart scheduling assistant** --- not just a
helper, but an AI brain that:

- Understands shift rules
- Detects scheduling conflicts
- Suggests balanced shift rotations
- Auto-generates full monthly schedules

---

## üöÄ Practical Use Cases

### 1. AI Auto-Scheduler

**Feature:**\
Click "üß† Generate Schedule with Gemini" ‚Üí Gemini creates a full
schedule automatically for all employees.

**Gemini's role:**\
It can: - Ensure each employee has 2 days off per week. - Distribute
shifts evenly (no one always gets night shifts). - Avoid overworking
someone more than 5 consecutive days. - Respect constraints (like
preferred off days).

**Prompt example to Gemini:**

```json
{
  "employees": [
    {
      "name": "Alice",
      "preferredShifts": ["Morning"],
      "maxConsecutiveDays": 5
    },
    { "name": "Bob", "preferredDaysOff": [6, 7] }
  ],
  "monthDays": 30,
  "shiftTypes": ["Morning", "Afternoon", "Night", "Off"]
}
```

Gemini can return a structured JSON with generated shifts per employee.

### 2. Smart Suggestions

While editing, Gemini could:

- Recommend next shifts based on past pattern (e.g., "‚ö†Ô∏è Alice worked
  4 mornings --- suggest off or afternoon").
- Predict potential overwork or imbalance.
- Auto-complete missing days logically.

---

### 3. Natural Language Commands

You could let users type:

> "Give Alice two days off this weekend and move her Monday shift to
> afternoon."

Gemini parses that and updates the schedule dynamically --- no need to
click cell by cell.

---

### 4. Fairness & Insights

Gemini can analyze the month and provide insights like:

- "Bob has 3 fewer off days than the team average."
- "Average streak is 4.2 days; ideal is 3--4."
- "Night shifts are not evenly distributed."

This makes the manager more aware of fairness and fatigue issues.

---

### 5. Template Generation

Gemini can create **templates** automatically:

> "Make me a rotation schedule for 8 employees, 3 shifts, 2 days off per
> week."

This gives a base template you can apply or tweak manually.

---

### 6. Conflict Resolution

If two employees are unavailable on the same day, Gemini could detect
and highlight conflicts:

> "‚ö†Ô∏è Both Alice and Bob are off on Friday --- shift coverage missing."

---

### 7. Natural Language Reports

At the end of the month, Gemini could summarize:

> "In February, Alice worked 18 morning shifts, 4 nights, and took 8
> days off."

This could auto-generate monthly reports or summaries for HR.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Notes

- Use **Google's Gemini API** (via `@google/generative-ai` npm
  package).
- Send your current schedule data as JSON in the prompt.
- Ask Gemini to return structured JSON for new or suggested data.
- You can keep everything local (frontend only) if you use **Firebase
  Functions** or a backend proxy to call Gemini securely.

**Example (simplified):**

```ts
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/generative-ai";

const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY);
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-1.5-pro" });

const result = await model.generateContent([
  {
    role: "user",
    parts: [
      {
        text: `Generate a fair 30-day schedule for these employees: ${JSON.stringify(
          employees
        )}`,
      },
    ],
  },
]);

const schedule = JSON.parse(result.response.text());
```
